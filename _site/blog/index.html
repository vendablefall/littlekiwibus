      <p>Hello and welcome to our first blog post! Hopefully one day we will be sitting in our tiny house bus reading this post remembering what it felt like to start on what we plan on being one of the biggest turning points of our lives! Moving back to New Zealand (my home country) to build our very own tiny house on wheels, our LitteKiwiBus.</p>

<p>The subject of this post is to show off what Bridget has been up to over the last few weekends. Building, and lots of it. Bridget started by dismantling an old computer desk of mine that was solid wood (hurray for free wood). She learnt how to use a circular saw.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:4000/images/image.jpg">Bridget on the Circular saw</a></p>

<p>She decided she would break down the table and make some planter boxs that she had been wanting for ages but didnt want to pay for. </p>

      <p>Today on the LittleKiwiBus were showing you what Bridget has been doing over the weekend, she has built a pallet chair. Not content with the planter boxs from <a href="link%20to%20last%20week">Last Week</a> Bridget wanted a bigger challenge, not simply wooden rectangles build from and old table. Throughout the week she had payed someone to drop off 7 palletts and some beautiful hardwood. </p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:4000/images/image.jpg">Pallett photo</a></p>

<p>She knew we needed outdoor furniture and had that in the back of her mind when she was browsing youtube for inspiration. She came accross <a href="link%20to%20yotube">this video</a> and liked the simplicity but also style of the design.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our first blog post! Thank you for stopping by and showing an interest in our adventures and misadventures. I wonder if you&#39;re as excited to be here as we are... probably not, I guess that would be weird.</p>

<p>One day in the not too distant future, we hope to be sitting in our cosy little house bus, parked up in one of New Zealand&#39;s countless paradises, reading this post and remembering what it felt like to be writing our first blog post, and taking the first few steps of one of the biggest turning points of our lives; the making of our very own tiny house on wheels, our Litte Kiwi Bus.</p>

<p>But that remains a dream at this stage. Let us rewind a little.</p>
