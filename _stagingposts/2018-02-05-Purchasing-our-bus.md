Bridget and I originally wanted to purchase an American school bus, which we were planning on importing into New Zealand (NZ), that was until we discovered the NZ road code prohibits left hand drive (LHD) heavy vehicles (anything over 4.5 tonne is classed as a heavy vehicle), as such we would of had to convert any LHD vehicle to right hand drive (RHD), which unfortunatley for us would involve allot of structural engineering. 
<!--more--> 

This dashed our hopes of getting a "skoolie", ever resolute, we shifted our focus to bus' that were already RHD and also already in NZ. We started trawling through [TradeMe](www.trademe.co.nz) NZ's number one online classifieds website, we searched for months, there was one bus late last year that we really liked, but we thought it may be too early in the process to purchase a bus as we dont plan on moving back to NZ until later this year (2018). It had everything we wanted, strong motor, still in original contition, service history, cool retro vibe, but we did not jump on it. It sold for a measly $3500 NZD, but alas it was not to be ours.. or so we thought.

Fast forward three months to January 2018, we had managed to organise a storage location for any potential bus and so were really keen to find our perfect bus. Three months of constant searching and we had nothing, nothing we liked, nothing we were prepared to sink our life savings into. Then we saw one, it was a 1977 Ford R1114, almost the same as the bus mentioned above, worse condition, more expensive, had been gutted and lived in for 4 years, but we still loved the asthetic. So we got in contact with the owners and organised for a pre-purchase inspection (at our expense), we were starting to get really excited. The news back from the inspection was not good, all the brakes need major overhauls, it needed new steering and the worst of all, rusted out sills... near the chassis. Our hopes were dashed, they were simply asking too much for a bus that needed almost everything important replaced. 

While feeling sorry for myself at work, I thought "fuck it, back to searching TradeMe", low and behold, what did I find, but the original 1979 Ford R1114 listed again, for $6000 NZD as its "Buy Now" price! I was exhilirated, I instantly tried to buy it, but then just before I did i thought i should really contact Bridget (B) and get her point of view on the issue (It is half hers after all). So I proceeded to call B, txt B, call B again... txt again (she is not very good at ansering her phone) by this time I was getting fustrated and desperate, i thought we were going to miss outr on the bus... again. I left work immediatley (it was about 3pm at this stage) on my walk home B returned my messaged thinking something had gone terribly wrong, after re-assuring her it was not an emergency but that i really wanted to buy this bus, and like now, she agreed to meet me at home and have a look.

Once we got home she tentivly agreed to buy the bus, she was concerned that we had not got a pre-purchase inspection on this bus (rightfully so) but I alayed her fears with evidence of a inspection on the bus from the add posted last year (the one we originally saw) and the fact that for this price, we can afford to fix most problems. A few short minutes later, it was real we had a purchase order for our dream bus. We were extatic, I immediatly walked down to the bottle store to buy some celebratory beers, to share with our flatmates.



Bridget and I finally have a bus to call our own, we purchased a 1979 Ford R1114, she is 11.5 meters (x ft) in length and 3 meters (x ft) tall.
