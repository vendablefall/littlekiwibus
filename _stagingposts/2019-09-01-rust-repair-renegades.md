Hey everyone, welcome back, this time we will be going through the high and low points of repairing the rust we found in our bus.

I (Alex) absolutely love classic cars, my second car ever was of the 1980's vintage (Ford Escort Mk2, for those that must know) and since then I have been obsessed. This obsession carried over to my bus buying preferences, I really didnt want to have to deal with all the excessive wiring and plastic parts that come with newer buses. Plus older busses are made from steel (or so I thought), and whats easier to work with than steel? Well it turns out our old bus is made from steel as i thought, but was skinned in aluminum and stainless steel, add in 40 years of leaky windows and you have yourself the makings of a 10 ton galvanic battery. To anyone who doesnt know what that is, its a reaction that occurs when metals of differing ionic potential come into contact in the presence of an electrolite (in this case water), it forms a lowe powered battery circut that oxidizes the steel ("rusts the steel" in other words). The sheer scale of the rust was not fully aparent to us untill we stripped out the interior panels and found the wall filled with "rust dust", needless to say this was a dissapointing finding, but we were not to be deterred, how hard can it be to repair rust....?

taking everything off so we could get to the rust.

cutting out rust

making new pieces

welding

rust proofing ( hammerite, rust coinvertor and under body sealer)
