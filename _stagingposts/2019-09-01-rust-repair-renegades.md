Hey everyone, welcome back, this time we will be going through the high and low points of repairing the rust we found in our bus.

I (Alex) absolutely love classic cars, my second car ever was of the 1980's vintage (Ford Escort Mk2, for those that must know) and since then I have been obsessed. This obsession carried over to my bus buying preferences, I really didnt want to have to deal with all the excessive wiring and plastic parts that come with newer buses. Plus older busses are made from steel (or so I thought), and whats easier to work with than steel? Well it turns out our old bus is made from steel as i thought, but was skinned in aluminum and stainless steel, add in 40 years of leaky windows and you have yourself the makings of a 10 ton galvanic battery. To anyone who doesnt know what that is, its a reaction that occurs when metals of differing ionic potential come into contact in the presence of an electrolite (in this case water), it forms a lowe powered battery circut that oxidizes the steel ("rusts the steel" in other words). The sheer scale of the rust was not fully aparent to us untill we stripped out the interior panels and found the wall filled with "rust dust", needless to say this was a dissapointing finding, but we were not to be deterred, how hard can it be to repair rust....?

<!-- taking everything off so we could get to the rust. need photos-->

The first step in dealing with all our rust was to get access so we could cut out the bad areas and replace it with shiny new (galvanised) steel. This meant we had to pull the skinn from the lower half of the bus (something we were hoping not to have to do) and also cut out the welded interior skin, and let me tell you, thats was one "special" job if i never have to do that again it will be too soon. with angle grinders in hand we had to seperate 1.5mm~ steel from the rusty old frame, with hardly any access and only 1mm grinding disks to do the job, we would essentially cut out all the welds we could access, then get out our turst old crowbar, bend some steel back, and go back to the angle grinder to cut pieces of the steel away to gain more access; this whole process when on for weeks and by the end of it, we were broken and battered both mentally and physically.

<!-- identifying the areas that needed to be replaced -->

With all the inconveniant panels and windows out of the way we were able to identify all of the areas (or so we thought) that needed replacing (not sure why they call it rust repair, when its reall rust replace :-O ). We bought a can of fluro green spray paint and everytime we spotted rust we would spray the affected area bright green, so it couldnt be missed. Below you can see a photo of the bus with all her fluro green makeup on (makeup??). We didnt find all the rust at the start, but never really expected to, we were happy with indentifying it as we worked, although it did make for a few late surprise discoveries.

<!-- cutting out rust -->


The most chalenging rust to cut out was definatley the 75x40mm beams that ran the length of the bus, just under the windows, these were the main structural support for the roof, and the whole side of the bus. We were to say the least, overwhelmed, what we ended up doing is putting up a few posters 

Cutting out the rust aws actually one of the easier jobs: find end of rust, go a little further, cut rusty section out, fin

<!-- making new pieces -->

Making replacement peices was again one of the easier tasks, welding is great in that you can (and should) fill gaps quite easily, so as long as the new piece was within a few mm at either side it was "good enough". this made the cutting and test fitting process much more stress free.

<!-- welding -->

Now at the start of the rust repair, I was scared and excited (feelings) by the end we were confident and sick of it. I definatley got a LOT better at welding throughout this build, and having Adam there on day one to set up the welder and give me some rusty metal tips made the start a  lot less confronting, and gave us to confidence to forge a new path, one full of holes in clothes and swearing as molten slag drops down your shoe... ahh the good times :p
