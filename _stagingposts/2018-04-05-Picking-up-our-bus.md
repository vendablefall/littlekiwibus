This is the epic story of how I (Alex) flew back to New Zealand (NZ) and with the help of many family and friends along the way, managed to take ownership of our bus (in the north island of NZ) and then drive it to our storage location (in the south island of NZ), this is also a tribute to all the wonderfull people along the way who made it possible.

Starting at the start, I had to fly to NZ from our current home of Brisbane Australia, because Bridget and I were trying to save as many pennies as possible for out bur conversion, we chose to fly out of the Gold Coast airport as the flights are almost half the price. On the eve of my flight a huge thunderstorm hit Brisabne, howling rain, thunder that made you jump and eye watering wind. Not ideal driving conditions, especially in our budget friendly 1997 Nissan Pulsar. I was not off to a good start, and i sincerely hoped that this was not an omen for the trip to come.

I managed to make it to the Gold Coast airport in one piece, the flight to Queenstown was uneventfull, my Mother kinldly met me at the airport and tooke me back to her place (love you mum). Once settled in at her house in Arrowtown I spend a couple of days catching up with my mum and sep dad before setting off on the longest road trip I have ever attempted.

The plan was simple: 

*Step 1* 
Catch a bus from Arrowtown to Dunedin (5hrs)

This leg almost went terribly wrong, my mother and I were watiing at the bus stop and we almost missed our bus, we were sitting in her car as it was a cool 6 degree (calcius) morning and so needed all the heat we could get. This unfortunatley meant that we didnt hear the call for Duniden, when the bus started to leave the station I managed to see the destination ticket on the entrance door Dunedin, it said. My heart dropped, i shot out of the car like a man possessed and stood in the driveway blocking the buss path. My mother was still inside the car coming to the realisation of what just almost happened. We managed to get on the bus and we found our seats, while wethering distinfull glares from all of the passengers who managed to take their seats at an appropirate time.

*Step 2*
Pick up a rental car and drive to Christchurch (4.5hrs)

We managed to get off the bus, collect our rental car, and drive to Christchurch without anything remarkibly exciting happening. My darling mother did take the opportunity to talk my ears off, but that was to be expected after not seeing her for the better part of a year, and we did almost "loose" her credit card at a petrol station when she threw it out with the coffee in the gutter, to which she promptly lost her nerve until we check the security camera showing her drop it on the street. We were starting to fall behind schedule.

*Step 3*
Pick up my uncle Alistars "trade plates" (which would allow us to drive the bus without it being 100% road legal)

Again this step was very univentfull, although I would like to give a big shout out to my uncle Alister for lending us these plates (see the photo below). In NZ you ware only allowed to drive a vehicle on the roads if it had passed a warrant of fitness (WOF) within the last 6 months, a WOF checks the brakes, lights, tyres and other general safety checks to make sure the vehucle is road legal. This is where the trade plates come in, with a set of these bad boys you can drive a vehicle without a WOF (our bus) to a place of repair (our paddock in Clyde) legally. So without my uncle and these plates we couldnt of driven our bus half way down the country, so thankyou Alistar.

*Step 4*
Drive to Picton (6.5hrs) drop of the rental car

<a class="image-captions">Filling up the rental car just before returning it.</a>

This was one of the most stressfull legs of the journey, the drive to Christchurch and picking up the trade plates had put us well behind schedule, we needed to be in picton by 6pm to drop of our rental car and it was 10am before we left Christchurch, leaving us only an hour and a half of extra time to account for delays. Remember that storm i was caught in driving to the gold coast from the start of this post, well that storm was actually the edge of a cyclone, a cyclone that went on to ravage the road from Christchurch to Picton meaning all traffic was diverted down a road that really wasnt cut out to be the only path from Christchurch to Picton. Couple that with a road slip every few kilomiters meant we were pressed for time, badly.

<expand on mum driving slow and me changing over, arguments etc>
we managed to get into Picton at 5:55pm just in time to avoid and late return fees put on us by the rental company.

*Step 5*
Catch the ferry to Wellington where we would meet my mothers cousin (insert name) and stay at his our that night.

This was the most enjoyable leg, my mother decided to upgrade us to the "lounge" ont he ferry meaning we had unlimited drinks and food, i ate untill i couldnt anymore, the 4 hour ferry ride was a welcome rest after 13ish hours of driving all day.

*Step 6*
The following day we would pickup the bus 

*Step 7*
Catch the 2pm ferry back to picton (4~hrs), 

*Step 8*
Drive from picton back to Clyde (14hrs) which is a short drive (0.45hrs) from Queenstown and mail the trade plates back to Alistar in Christchurch.
