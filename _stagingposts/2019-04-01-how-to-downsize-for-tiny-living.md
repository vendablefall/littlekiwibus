One of the biggest tasks we have to accomplish is fitting everything we have acome accustomed to into a 2300x1100mm bus chassis. Over the years we have accumulated all manner of stuff, and things, so many things, we never really understood how much untill we started sorting it all. This leads us to the topic of todays post, How to downsize for tiny living.
