With society constantly telling us that material posesssions equal happiness, it's too easy to get caught up in this idea; the false (and frankly toxic) idea of what "success" looks like.

I arrived in Australia in 2015 with a backpack and the shoes on my feet. Everything I owned could fit comfortably into a 60l backpack, and weighed 17.9kg. Fast forward 4 years and the time has come to set sail again. The packing up process this time around has highlighted the alarming reality of just how much *stuff* I have accumulated. All this *stuff* that I've bought over the last few years because I felt, at the time, like it would bring me happiness in some way.

I've been putting off culling my posessions for some time now. It's daunting, and I didn't have anything pushing me to do it. But if moving overseas to live in a bus isn't a good enough prompt to downsize, I don't know what is.

There have been some things that have been difficult to part with, but the effect of detatching myself from all this *stuff* is becoming strikingly clear. It has been one of the most liberating things I've done in a long time, has worked wonders for my mental health, and I only wish I'd done it sooner.

We become so attached to our posessions, it can be hard to imagine life without them. But trust me, it's a lot easier to feel calm, focused, proud, present when your space is uncluttered. So with this in mind, I thought I'd share some tips I've discovered along my downsizing journey, in hope that they might help make this transition easier for you.

Stop thinking *what if*
*What if* is a hoarder's favourite phrase. *What if* I finally fix that plant pot? *What if* I suddenly decide I want to wear this dress I haven't worn in 4 years? *What if* my feet shrink and manage to squeeze back into these shoes? Chances are, if you start your question with these two words, the simple answer is **you probably won't**.

Start early
This is a very important step, *if* it suits your timeline. Not only does it minimise stress, it is vital in order to downsize responsibly. Sure it would be easy to fill up a bunch of black bags and put them outside on Tuesday night for the bin man to collect and for you to never have to think about again. But this is simply not good enough. Give yourself enough time to plan where each item will go. You do have to be a bit brutal when downsizing, but that doesn't necessarily mean dumping it all in the trash. Remember there are so many options to explore before choosing trash/recycling. Sell, gift, upcycle, donate, to name a few. Just because these things no longer serve you, doesn't mean they can't serve anyone else.

Give your pre-loved items to your friends
It's always nice to give a meaningful gift, for all parties involved. Especially if you're in my positon and you're downsizing because you're leaving the country. It's a sweet combination of giving your loved ones something to remember you by, giving something you've loved a second life, and receiving the gift of gratitude yourself. Everyone wins. 

Sell
You'd be surprised how high the demand for your junk is. lol

Clothes
If you're anything like me, you have a wardrobe full of perfectly fine clothes, yet you seem to just rotate through a very select few. This time last year, knowing that I had one of each season to get through before the big move, I decided it was a good time for action. Trying to pick out the items I didn't need was just painful; I managed to find an excuse to keep almost everything I picked out. I needed a system. So I took my two brown belts and I hung them on the far right of the hanging rail in my wardrobe. As I wore items of clothing, I would put them back on the right hand side of the belts. It was a slow process. *(This comes back to starting early, allowing time to make the right decisions.)* For a good 3 months (summer) I never exceeded 4 items on the "keep" side! Demand was a bit higher in the colder months, 

Shoes

Household products
Different types of ceaner not necessary. Vinegar. Great excuse to transition into a low impact lifestyle.

Cosmetics
Same Same

Paperwork
There are some original documents that need to be kept, but

While you're there, clean digital clutter. Delete old emails, contacts etc

Downsize responsibly
Repurpose
Donate
Give to friends
Recycle
Sell - you'd be surprised how much some things sell for
