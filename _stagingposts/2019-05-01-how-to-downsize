Downsizing is "in" right now. And for once, I actually understand a trend! With society constantly telling us that material posesssions equal happiness, it's too easy to get caught up in this idea; the false (and frankly toxic) idea of what "success" looks like.

I arrived in Australia in 2015 with a backpack and the shoes on my feet. Everything I owned could fit comfortably into a 60l backpack, and weighed 17.9kg. Fast forward 4 years and the time has come to set sail again. The packing up process this time around has highlighted the alarming reality of just how much *stuff* I have accumulated. All this *stuff* that I've bought over the last few years because I felt, at the time, like it would bring me happiness in some way.

I've been putting off culling my posessions for some time now. It's daunting, and I didn't have anything pushing me to do it. But if moving overseas to live in a bus isn't a good enough prompt to downsize, I don't know what is.

There have been some things that have been difficult to part with, but the effects of detatching myself from all these *things* is becoming strikingly clear. It has been one of the most liberating activities I've done in a long time. Simply removing clutter from my life has worked wonders for my mental health, and I only wish I'd done it sooner.

We become so attached to our posessions, it can be hard to imagine life without them. But trust me, it's a lot easier to feel calm, focused, proud, present when your space is uncluttered. So with this in mind, I thought I'd share some tips I've discovered along my downsizing journey, in hope that they might help make this transition easier for you.

Stop thinking *what if*
*What if* is a hoarder's favourite phrase. *What if* I finally fix that plant pot? *What if* I suddenly decide I want to wear this dress I haven't worn in 4 years? *What if* my feet shrink and manage to squeeze back into these shoes? Chances are, if you start your question with these two words, the simple answer is **you probably won't**.

Start early
This is a very important step, *if* it suits your timeline. Not only does it minimise stress, it is vital in order to downsize responsibly. Sure, it would be easy to fill up a bunch of black bags and put them outside on Tuesday night for the bin man to collect and for you to never have to think about again. But this is simply not good enough. Give yourself enough time to plan where each item will go. You do have to be a bit brutal when downsizing, but that doesn't necessarily mean dumping it all in the trash. Remember there are so many options to explore before choosing trash/recycling. Sell, gift, upcycle, donate, to name a few. Just because these things no longer serve you, doesn't mean they can't serve anyone else.

Give your pre-loved items to your friends
It's always nice to give a meaningful gift, for all parties involved. Especially if you're in my positon and you're downsizing because you're leaving the country. It's a sweet combination of giving your loved ones something to remember you by, giving something you've loved a second life, and receiving the gift of gratitude yourself. Everyone wins. 

Sell
When calculating my budget for the coming months, I didn't even consider any potential profits from selling anything. Everything I own I've either been handed down, bought second hand or I've made. My mind has been a little bit blown by the things I've managed to make money from; things that I've considered rotting junk for so long. And selling the pieces I built myself has given me a healthy little ego boost, as well as a much appreciated monetary bonus. Two pieces of advice for you which might seem obvious: 
1. Do your research. Find out what your item is worth new if you can, but more importantly, find out how much similar second hand items are selling for around the internets. If other people are asking for $200 for a bed frame like yours, it would be a shame for your to list it for $50 because you;re just not aware of its value.
2. List your items for more than you think they're worth. The first few things I sold got snapped up straight away, no haggling, heaps of interest. Even though I don't consider myself particularly money-oriented, it still stung a bit to be given a twenty dollar note knowing I could probably have got five twenty dollar notes if I'd tried.

Free listings
If you can't sell something for some reason but wan't to give it a second life, list it for free! People **love** free shit. Trust me. I put a selection of grotty plant pots up for free, within less than 2 minutes I had dozens of messages and very urgent calls practically begging me to hold the pots for them! We use Gumtree because it's easy and very commonly used here, but you will have various options depending on where you are in the world (ebay, trademe, freecycle, craigslist, facebook marketplace, etc, etc).

Clothes
If you're anything like me, you have a wardrobe full of perfectly fine clothes, yet you seem to just rotate through a very select few. This time last year, knowing that I had one of each season to get through before the big move, I decided it was a good time for action. Trying to pick out the items I didn't need was just painful; I managed to find an excuse to keep almost everything I picked out. I needed a system. So I took my two brown belts and I hung them on the far right of the hanging rail in my wardrobe. As I wore items of clothing, I would put them back on the right hand side of the belts. It was a slow process. *(This comes back to starting early, allowing time to make the right decisions.)* For a good 3 months (summer) I never exceeded 4 items on the "keep" side. Demand was a bit higher in the colder months, as more layers became necessary. But it is now blatantly clear which 40% of my clothes is worth space in my life, and which 60% is not.
Another tip for garment culling (time dependant): put all the things you think you want to donate in a box in the corner and leave for a few months. This will give you a chance to change your mind before it's too late, meaning you'll feel more confident with your final decision when you do make it.

Shoes
Unless you have lots of specific hobbies that require specific shoes, you really don't need more than 5 pairs. And this is being generous. Your selection might vary depending on your climate, hobbies, preference, etc - but when you have 9 options for flip flops (/jandals/thongs) to wear to the beach, and another 12 options for running shoes, it's probably a good idea to reevaluate whether they actually add value to your life, or whether they're just a burden.

Household products
The endless list of cleaning and skincare products we're constantly told we need in order to meet societal standards is a load of BS. Cleaning-wise, you really don't need much more than vinegar, bicarb, lemon juice and salt. Maybe some herbs or flowers from the garden to infuse for a fresher fragrance. But you definitely do not *need* whole cupboards dedicated to every cleaning product on the market.
Skincare-wise, everyone is different, but from my own experience the best possible change I made to my skincare routine was to completely simplify it, and stop using harsh chemicals on my skin. For years I tried so many face washes, scrubs, gels, all promising me they would clear my skin in x amount of days. It felt hopeless. Surely spending more money meant better results, right? Unfortunately (or fortunately if you're smart) that's not how it works. If you achieve that perfect complexion youve been chasing, you stop needing their products.
