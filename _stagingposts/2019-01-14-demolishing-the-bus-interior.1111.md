We're back! Back into our routines after three very exciting weeks in New Zealand. We're still blissfully full of ham, Christmas pudding & Terry's Chocolate Oranges, and we even still have a bit of Christmas cheer.. but physically, we are pooped.

 It was three weeks of physical labour. It was all very exciting, but equally gruelling. Half our holiday was spent inside the bus in the sweltering heat; the other half was spent crouched down underneath the bus with all our new spider friends. It was a labour of love, one we would gladly do over again. (Just not anytime soon, just so we're clear.)
 
 We had our ups and downs; physically, mentally and emotionally. Alex whacked both of us (on separate occasions) in the face with a crowbar. Accidentally, I should add. That was definitely a lowlight. We had our usual trivial disagreements. I tend to under-communicate while Alex tends to over-communicate; an endless source of contention between us. There were days when we put everything we had into the job at hand, and had nothing to show for it at the end of the day, which was pretty deflating.

 But we accomplished everything we set out to, and didn't lose any fingers, or *too many* marbles, in the process. What really amazed me was how long we spent tackling the first 10% of some tasks, but as soon as we'd figured out the most effective methods, the preceeding 90% took relatively no time at all. This was the reason we decided to write this blog post, and place the focus on how we overcame some of the more laborious tasks, what we found out along the way, and how we would do it more efficiently next time. And maybe you can cut through your 100% like we did our 90%.

 So, to get you started, here is a list of tools that will make the demolition stages a whole lot easier:

 TODO: bullet points

 Reciprocating saw (and LOTS of blades if you chew through them as quickly as we do)
 Angle grinder
 Drill
 Impact driver
 Chisel bit for impact driver
 Crowbars (watch your face)
 Socket seto
 Rivet remover (find example onlinem say we couldnt find one in nz but tom suggestd it)
 Radio/music speaker (to keep you sane)
 

One of the first tasks we had to tackle was the removal of the luggage compartments on the roof. We had already arranged to donate the seats to Otago Bus Heritage Society; they have a 1960s Bedford bus with no seats that they're restoring, and we had a bus full of seats that would fit perfectly into it. We thought about trying to remove the overhead luggage compartments neatly, in case they had a use for them too. Unfortunately these good intentions lasted about 10 minutes. After a closer examination, we realised that taking them out without destroying them wasn't going to happen. The bus really wasn't built with the intention of being pulled apart. The compartments ran almost the whole length of the bus and even if we could detach them without destroying them we wouldn't have been able to get them out the door. So we turned to our favourite "shortcut tool", the reciprocating saw. We decided to cut the compartments into thirds and cut as close to the edge as we could, allowing us to pull out the bulk of the compartments, so we could get to the rivets that were holding them in place. 

Well, we had to get past the manky old wall carpet first. (Does anyone else find wall carpets just a bit odd?) Luckily removing this carpet was just a case of yanking them out, and only injuring our backs slightly in the process.

Then came the rivets. Ah the rivets. I'd never used, or even seen a rivet before this project. So removing the first rivet was almost fun. Now I never want to see another rivet again.

We removed the rivets with a drill. The trick is to start with a drill bit slightly smaller than the rivet to make a pilot hole, and then change to a bit the same size as the rivet. My brother (who's nearly more into this project than we are) advised we should look for a "rivet remover", but when we went to the local Mitre 10 (for the 6th time that morning) they claimed it didn't exist. As we were in a small town we didn't really have any other options, so we went back to our drill. However we consulted senor Google later on, and learnt that it definitely is a thing, you can get one on Amazon for $50. Damn you, small town Mitre 10. If I could give you just one piece of advice for your own demolition: get yourself a rivet remover! I can't vouch for their efficiency as we didn't get to use one, but the name suggests it's the tool for the job. And drilling out a rivet is no fun at all. Drilling out thousands of rivets is even less fun.

Thousands of rivets later, the inside skin from the bus was stripped. Weary, sore and dangerously low on enthusiasm, we moved on to the carpet (floor carpet).

Then came the seemingly impossible job of removing the carpet from the wooden floors. It was seriously stuck to the floor. We tried and failed for *hours*. Remember the 10% I talked about earlier? Well we spent hours on this 10%. We tried pulling it up without gloved hands, both individually and together. All we gained from this were two very sore backs, and two very grumpy moods. In the end we bought a chisel end for our impact driver and one person drove the chisel inbetween the carpet and the floor while the other person yanked at the carpet. We did half of the carpet in one go. Needless to say it was *extrememly* hard, inefficient and demoralising. One trick we found made it all a lot easier was to cut strips in the carpet with a blade and just work in sections, rather than try and pull it all at once.hh

Once the carpet had been removed and discarded (good riddance!), we attempted to pull up the wooden boards underneath. We thought it would just be a case of wedging the crowbar underneath and forcing it up... Wishful thinking. I tried this. It didn't budge. Alex tried this. It didn't budge. After a lengthy fight between the crowbar and the wooden board (a fight with no winner and four losers) we noticed a big flathead screw holding it down. That explained that, and it seemed like an easy fix; we just needed to follow the screw in a straight line to find the rest, and once we find one and know the exact distance between them, it will be easy.... right? Surely there will be a pattern to where the screws are? As we say here in Australia; yeah nah. No pattern. Every time we thought we were onto something, we'd measure the distance where the next screw should be, and nothing. I should also point out that we couldn't see the wooden board, as half the carpet was still stuck to it, so locating these mystery screws was not as straight forward as it should have been.

I really hope it's easier for you, and your carpet comes off cleanly so that you don't have to faff about as much as we did. BUT if you're ever faced with mystery screws hiding under a stubborn layer of 40 year old carpet, we found the most effective way to tackle it was with a wire end on an angle grinder. This way, even if the screw isn't where it should be, you've only wasted a second or two grinding through the layer of carpet to find this out.

Once we'd finally located and removed all the screws and taken the floorboards out, we could see that even though it seemed, at a glance, that there was no pattern to where the screws were placed, they followed the sctructural beams underneath the floor. It seems obvious now, but if you're having trouble locating screws in your floorboards, have a quick look underneath the bus to see if you can make any sense of it.

It took us days and days to figure this all out and find the best method. As you can imagine, pulling that last floorboard up felt *great*!
