We have just got home from our nice _realaxing_ three week holiday in New Zealand, I say just but I really mean 9 days ago. The holiday was so _relaxing_ that we needed a week to recover, much of the three weeks in New Zealand was spent inside, underneath or dangling from our beautiful bus. It was a labor of love, one I would gladly do again (but not soon). We had our ups and downs, I tend to under-communicate while Alex tends to over-communicate, a source of endless contention; but we got through it in one piece. What really amazed me is how it took so long to tackle 10% of some tasks, but once a better method of working was found, the preceeding 90% took relativley no time at all. This is the focus of this blog post, how we overcame some of the more laborius tasks, so maybe you can cut through your 100% like we did our 90%.

One of the first tasks we had to tackle was the removal of the luggage compartments on the roof.

Rivets.. so many rivets..

Another tough feat was removing the carpet from the wooden floors.
