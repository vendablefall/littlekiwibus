We're back! Back into our routines after three very exciting weeks in New Zealand. We're still blissfully full of ham, Christmas pudding & Terry's Chocolate Oranges, and we even still have a bit of Christmas cheer.. but physically, we are pooped.

 It was three weeks of gruelling physical labour. Exciting, but gruelling. Half our holiday was spent inside the bus in the sweltering heat; the other half was spent crouched down underneath the bus with all our new spider acquaintances. It was a labour of love, one we would gladly do all over again. (Not anytime soon, just so we're clear.)
 
 We had our ups and downs; physically, mentally and emotionally. Alex whacked both of us (on separate occasions) in the face with a crowbar. Accidentally, I should add. That was definitely a lowlight. We had our usual trivial disagreements. I tend to under-communicate while Alex tends to over-communicate; an endless source of contention between us. There were days when we put everything we had into the job at hand, and had nothing to show for it at the end of the day. That was demoralising to say the least.

 blahblah
 
 But we did everything we set out to do, and got through it in one piece. What really amazed me is how it took so long to tackle the first 10% of some tasks, but as soon as we'd figured out the most effective and efficient methods, the preceeding 90% took relativley no time at all. This will the focus of this blog post; how we overcame some of the more laborious tasks, what we found out along the way, and how we would do it more efficiently next time. And maybe you can cut through your 100% like we did our 90%.

 So, to get you started, here is a list of tools that will make the demolition stages a whole lot easier:

 Reciprocating saw (and LOTS of blades if you chew through them as quickly as we do)
 Angle grinder
 Drill
 Impact driver
 Chisel bit for impact driver
 

One of the first tasks we had to tackle was the removal of the luggage compartments on the roof.

Rivets.. so many rivets..

Another tough feat was removing the carpet from the wooden floors.

finding the bolts in said floors
