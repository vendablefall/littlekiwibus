This is the epic story of how I (Alex) flew back to New Zealand (NZ) and with the help of many family and friends along the way, managed to take ownership of our bus (in the north island of NZ) and then drive it to our storage location (in the south island of NZ), this is also a tribute to all the wonderfull people along the way who made it possible.

Starting at the start, I had to fly to NZ from our current home of Brisbane Australia, because Bridget and I were trying to save as many pennies as possible for out bur conversion, we chose to fly out of the Gold Coast airport as the flights are almost half the price. On the eve of my flight a huge thunderstorm hit Brisabne, howling rain, thunder that made you jump and eye watering wind. Not ideal driving conditions, especially in our budget friendly 1997 Nissan Pulsar. I was not off to a good start, and i sincerely hoped that this was not an omen for the trip to come.

I managed to make it to the Gold Coast airport in one piece
