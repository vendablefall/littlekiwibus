Hello and welcome to our first blog post! Hopefully one day we will be sitting in our tiny house bus reading this post remembering what it felt like to start on what we plan on being one of the biggest turning points of our lives! Moving back to New Zealand (my home country) to build our very own tiny house on wheels, our LitteKiwiBus.

The subject of this post is to show off what Bridget has been up to over the last few weekends. Building, and lots of it. Bridget started by dismantling an old computer desk of mine that was solid wood (hurray for free wood). She learnt how to use a circular saw.

She decided she would break down the table and make some planter boxs that she had been wanting for ages but didnt want to pay for.
