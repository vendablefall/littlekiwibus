As you should know by now, Bridget is looking at becomming a skilled wood worker (if you dont know, check out our [intro]({{site.url}}/2017/05/09/Introductions.html)). For her first project she set her sights on an old computer desk that I no longer needed. Rather than throw perfectly good wood away we thought we could use it as a perfect starter project.

Above you can see me standing in front of the desk we used, with appropriate safety gear of course, safety first! This was to be her first attempt at using any kind of power tools, below is a photo of bridget practising with the circular saw:

She decided she would break down the table into its base parts and make some planter boxs that she had been desperatly wanting, but was unwilling to pay for as in her opinion "everything is so overpriced these days".
