The "covered platform" was to be my first real welding project, I am quite happy with how strong and square it turned out. The shelf that the BBQ sits on however... is not square at all, It was the last welding task i needed to get done, at the end of my third day straight welding, I was tired and wanted to get the job done, so I rushed it. I am okay with the "unsquare" shelf as this excersize was to build something solid and practical. My "covered platform" still meets these requirements even with the rushed shelf.

How does one build a platform like this, without any descernable welding skills? you may ask yourself. YouTube was my answer, more specifically [ChuckE2009's channel]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjYPJ-CxxW4 ). These Videos give a great introduction to Stick/Arc welding and gave me enough knowledge to start practising my beads.

 Once I felt confident enough to take on my frist project I started to draw up plans for the "covered platform" that would move our BBQ and Dryer from our outside entertaining area, to what was essentially our garden previously.

I learnt allot from building this platform including setting up your weld, laying a bead, slecting the correct amperage on the welder, the list goes on. What it really did was it gave me a real world application of all the tips I had gained from ChuckE2009. Real world applications are invaluable to a would-be learner, It give you so much more exposure to all the little issues that arise that no textbook or tutorial can cater for.
