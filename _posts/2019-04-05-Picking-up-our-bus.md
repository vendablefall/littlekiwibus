This is the epic tale of how I (Alex) proudly took ownership of our bus, and took it on an unforgettable journey from Wellington (North Island) to our storage location in Clyde (South Island). This is also a tribute to all the wonderful, generous souls who helped us along the way, and together made it all possible.

This is the epic story of how I (Alex) flew back to New Zealand (NZ) and with the help of many family and friends along the way managed to take ownership of our bus (in the North Island of NZ) and then drive it to our storage location (in the South island of NZ). This is also a tribute to all the wonderful people along the way who made it possible.

I guess I'll start at the start. First of all, I had to get from our current home in Brisbane to New Zealand - more specifically, Arrowtown, where Mum was waiting for me. Bridget wasn't able to come (visa complications) which was a big old shame, and also added a ton of pressure - this was all on me! 

I decided to fly from the Gold Coast rather than directly from Brisbane, as the flights are almost half the price, and we're in full penny-saving mode. On the eve of my flight a huge thunderstorm hit Brisbane; howling rain, eye-watering wind, and thunder that made you jump. I was hopeful it would subside by the morning - storms never last long here. But it didn't. Not ideal driving conditions, especially in our budget friendly 1997 Nissan Pulsar. I was not off to a good start, and I sincerely hoped that this was not an omen for the trip to come.

It was a rather unpleasant drive. Good drivers seem to turn into average drivers in the rain, average drivers turn into bad drivers, and already bad drivers turn into absolute maniacs! I managed to make it to the Gold Coast airport in one piece. The flight to Queenstown was uneventful (which was nice), and Mum kindly met me at the airport and took me back to her place (love you Mum). Once settled in at her house in Arrowtown, I enjoyed a couple of days catching up with her and Dennis (step-dad) before setting off on the longest road trip I have ever attempted.

The plan was simple: 

*Step 1* 
Catch a bus from Arrowtown to Dunedin (5hrs)

<a class="image-captions">The bus we almost missed</a>

This leg was terribly close to going terribly wrong. Mum and I almost missed our bus... even though we were waiting at the bus stop. It was a cool 6 degree (celcius) morning and so we were sitting in her car, in an attempt to keep warm. We stayed warmer than we would have outside, but it did also mean that we didn't hear the call for Dunedin. I spotted the destination ticket on the entrance door of the bus just as it was pulling out of the station. Dunedin. My heart dropped. I shot out of the car like a man possessed and stood in the driveway blocking the bus' path. My mother was still inside the car coming to the realisation of what just almost happened. We got on the bus and we shamefully found our seats, while wethering distinful glares from all of the passengers who'd managed to take their seats at an appropriate time.

*Step 2*
Pick up a rental car and drive to Christchurch (4.5hrs)

We managed to get off the bus, collect our rental car, and drive to Christchurch without anything remarkable happening. My darling mother did take the opportunity to talk my ears off, but that was to be expected after not seeing her for the better part of a year. We did also almost "lose" her credit card at a petrol station, when she absent-mindedly threw it out with the coffee in the gutter, to which she promptly lost her nerve until we check the security camera showing her drop it on the street. We were starting to fall behind schedule.

*Step 3*
Pick up my uncle Alistars "trade plates" (which would allow us to drive the bus without it being 100% road legal)

This leg of journey was rather smooth, apart from taking slightly longer than anticipated. I would like to give a big shout out to my uncle Alistair for lending us his trade plates (see the photo below) and making this whole journey possible. In NZ you are only allowed to drive a vehicle on the roads if it has passed a warrant of fitness (WOF) within the last 6 months. A WOF checks the brakes, lights, tyres and other general safety checks to make sure the vehicle is road legal. This is where the trade plates come in. With a set of these bad boys you can drive a vehicle without a WOF (our bus) to a place of repair (our paddock in Clyde) legally. So without my uncle and these plates we couldn't have driven our bus half way down the country, so thank you Alistair.

*Step 4*
Drive to Picton (6.5hrs) drop of the rental car

This was one of the most stressful legs of the journey. The drive to Christchurch and picking up the trade plates had put us well behind schedule. We needed to be in Picton by 6pm to drop off our rental car and it was 10am before we left Christchurch, leaving us only an hour and a half of extra time to account for delays. Remember that storm I mentioned I was caught in driving to the Gold Coast to catch my flight, well that storm was actually the edge of a cyclone, a cyclone that went on to ravage the road from Christchurch to Picton meaning all traffic was diverted down a road that really wasn't cut out to be the only path from Christchurch to Picton. Couple that with a road slip every few kilomiters meant we were pressed for time, badly.

<expand on mum driving slow and me changing over, arguments etc>
we managed to get into Picton at 5:55pm just in time to avoid and late return fees put on us by the rental company.

*Step 5*
Ferry to Wellington

This was the most enjoyable leg. Mum decided to upgrade us to the "lounge" on the ferry meaning we had unlimited food & drinks. I ate until i couldn't eat anymore. The 4 hour ferry ride was a welcome rest after 13+ hours of driving all day. Once we arrived in Wellington we were met at the harbour by my mother's cousin, Lester. We stayed the night as his place ready to pick the bus up the next day.

*Step 6*
Pick up the bus 

As luck turned out the bus was parked just a few minutes drive from cousin Lester's house, he kindly gave us a ride to the Marai where the bus was stored. I still remember the first timeI saw her, over the crest of a modest hill, the first thing that struck me was her sheer size. You can tell yourslef youve bought a 12 tonne bus a million time, but untill you actually see it in the flesh its hard to comprehend. 

*Step 7*
Learn to drive a 1970's bus and catch the ferry

The next part was, interesting to say the least. I was quite confident in driving the trucks I had learnt on back in Australia, this however was another challenge all together. For starters, our bus was manual, almost none of the schynros worked in the gearbox, the steering neededs a lot of tightning, the mirrors were too covered in mould to be any use and the roads were allot smaller than the industrial complex I learned to drive on. Literally the first corner I had to make, I got stuck and had to ask a lady to move her parked car because my turning angle would of contacted with her car and to get out of the situation i would have to preform a reverse hillstart around the corner i just came from. Antoher notable event was when my mum took up navigating for us, she also took us through Wellignton CBD at peak hour, once we realised where we were I distinctly remember banning all talking inside the bus untill we were out of this mess (we can laugh about it now however). After a few eventful practise drives, it was time to get back onto the ferry to start our return journey. Nothing of note happened except me stalling three times through nerves leaving the ferrys loading ramp, the staff were not imporessed.

*Step 8*
Drive from Picton back to Clyde 

The drive from Picton to clyde is usuall 14hrs by car, easy we thought, we will take turns and burn the midnight oil we wil; be back in one night! or so we thought, turns out 14 hours by car equates to 22 hours by bus with steering and gearbox that needs work. twenty two hours is far to much to do in one go, so we parked up in some non-descript small town at about 3am, when I started to fategue, we were 12 hours into our drive. The next day actualkly went quite quickly (mentally) we were on the home stretch, all we had to do was drive home, no more stress, no more deadlines. We stopped of at a few coffee shops and food carts along the way, and even picked up a couple of hitchikers you can see below. They were with us for a 2-3 hours while we decended the west coast before making the cross over into the great lakes district.
