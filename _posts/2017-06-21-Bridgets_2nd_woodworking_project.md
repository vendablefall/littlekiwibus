There are many things in this world that bring us joy, and they vary greatly from one person to the next. For some people, it's being in love; for some it's doing well in their job; for some it's doing good deeds and making other people happy. Sometimes it can be something as simple as a beautiful flower, or an ice cream, or a favourite song. For me, one of the things that makes me feel truly good is learning. There is something so magical about learning. It's exciting and inspiring, and a nice little reminder that the world really is our oyster.

I've lived my life, up until very recently, thinking it's just one big shame that there is nothing I'm great at. I'm average to good at quite a few things. But I've never found that one thing that I'm great at. And for a long time I just accepted that. Accepted that I'm simply not one of those people who were just given a gift. How stupid is that?!

If Alex has taught me one thing, it's that achieving greatness comes through hard work and dedication. Alex has a good job in which he's highly competent, and he loves it. And I've always thought he's lucky to have that. But I realise now; he's not lucky. He's just worked his ass off to get to where he is. He doesn't know everything he knows because he was born with it. He knows it because he's put hours and hours of hard work in, and actively ensured that he is always learning, and always ahead of his game. He focuses on what makes him happy, rather than what other people think he should be doing, and works (hard) on that to be the best person he can be. And not just in his job. In day to day life, he's always seemed to just be *good at things*. But as I've got to know him better over the years, I've come to realise that this isn't by chance, it's because he's not afraid to try. And sometimes he fails, but he's never ashamed of it.

So I've decided to take a leaf out of Alex's book. I've taken the woodworking reigns with confidence, and left the fear of failing, or not being good enough, behind. Alex recently wrote a blog post about my first project, a planter box for my vegetables (you can check it out here), but since then I've been very busy and made us an outdoor couch!









Today on the LittleKiwiBus were showing you what Bridget has been doing over the weekend, she has built a pallet chair. Not content with the planter boxs from [Last Week](link to last week) Bridget wanted a bigger challenge, not simply wooden rectangles build from and old table. Throughout the week she had payed someone to drop off 7 palletts and some beautiful hardwood.

She knew we needed outdoor furniture and had that in the back of her mind when she was browsing youtube for inspiration. She came accross [this video](link to yotube) and liked the simplicity but also style of the design.


It's a pretty cool feeling, making something, or doing something, or saying something, then standing back and thinking, "Wow. I wouldn't have known how to make/do/say that yesterday!"
