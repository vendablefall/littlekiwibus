Today on the LittleKiwiBus were showing you what Bridget has been doing over the weekend, she has built a pallet chair. Not content with the planter boxs from [Last Week](link to last week) Bridget wanted a bigger challenge, not simply wooden rectangles build from and old table. Throughout the week she had payed someone to drop off 7 palletts and some beautiful hardwood.

She knew we needed outdoor furniture and had that in the back of her mind when she was browsing youtube for inspiration. She came accross [this video](link to yotube) and liked the simplicity but also style of the design.
